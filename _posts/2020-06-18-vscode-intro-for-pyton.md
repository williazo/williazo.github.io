I am back on a roll now with blogging and I can feel the momentum. This week I wanted spend some time going over an introduction to one of my favorite new discoveres, [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com).

Visual Studio Code, commonly referred to as vscode, in its most simple sense is a text editor, but it is a text editor on steroids. This software was developed by the Microsoft Team and has become extremely popular within the software develoment community.

While it has become widely accepted among developers, vscode is also gaining increasing popularity among data scientists due to its Pyton compatibility.

## vscode-Python

We can add the Python extension from the vscode marketplace

### Integration with Jupyter Notebooks

As someone who was introduced into statistical programming primarily using R, I have struggled everytime I have tried to switch to working in Python because I had become so dependent on the RStudio IDE.

## Additional Notes

- There are extensions for working in R with vscode. From my brief experience it works really well for handling R Markdown, i.e., files with .rmd extensions, but lacks many of the qualities that make working in RStudio seamless such as viewing the data environment and plots. I need to spend some more time playing around with writing R code using vscode-R, and I will refrain full judgement until that point.
