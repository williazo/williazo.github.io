# Background

- Gold standard for answering causal questions is the randomized clinical trial
    - Balance on known and unknown confounders
- However, using the gold standard RCT may not be possible in real world settings
    - Unrealistic, e.g., surgery vs. placebo
    - Unethical, e.g., forcing patients to smoke

- How to estimate causal effects without randomization?
    - Exposure may be systematically related to outcome

- Utilize propensity score method `r Citep(myBib,"rosenbaum_propensity")`

> .small[.dodger-blue[Propensity score] = Probability of receiving exposure given set of confounders]

\begin{align}
\Pr(D=1\mid C)

# Brief History of Propensity Score

**Estimation**
1. Originally proposed by `r Citet(myBib,"rosenbaum_propensity")`
    - Handled binary exposure only, i.e., exposed vs. control
1. Methods extended to categorical, or multiple, treatments by `r Citet(myBib,"imbens_dose_resp")`
    - Term "generalized propensity score" (GPS) is introduced
1. Adaptions for continuous treatments introduced by `r Citet(myBib, c("hirano_continuous", "imai_causalGPS"))`
    - Use Gaussian densities for estimating probability of exposure level

**Bias Removal**
1. Covariate adjustment
1. Subclassification/stratification
1. Matching
1. Inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW)

???
- Throughout we use GPS to refer to continuous rather than categorical treatment

# Propensity Score with Continuous Exposure

# Multivariate Continuous Exposures

- All methodological development has focused on single univariate continuous exposure
    - Multiple exposures noted only briefly in `r Citet(myBib, "imai_causalGPS")`
- Need for methods to handle multivariate exposures
    - Identify potential combination therapies from observational studies
        - COVID-19 treatments `r Citep(myBib, c("covid_tx_review"))`
    - Estimate combined effects of childhood obesity intervention programs in the community
- Challenges:
    - Define multivariate densities for generalized propensity score
    - Multiple sets of confounders
    - Correlation of exposures
    - Assessing high dimensional balance
    - Properly defining estimable multivariate region for inference

# Multivariate Generalized Propensity Score
## mvGPS

# Notation

- $Y$: outcome of interest
- $\mathbf{D}$: multivariate exposure of dimension $m$
    - In simulation study and application we fix $m=2$, i.e., bivariate exposure
- $\mathcal{C}=\{\mathbf{C}_{1}, \dots, \mathbf{C}_{m}\}$: set of random variables of
length $m$
    - Each $\mathbf{C}_{j}$ for $j=1,\dots,m$, is a $p_{j}$ vector of baseline
    confounders associated with the $j^{th}$ exposure and outcome
- $Y_{i}(\mathbf{d})$: potential outcome of $i^{th}$ subject assigned exposure
vector $\mathbf{d}=(d_{1},\dots,d_{m})$
- $\mu(\mathbf{d})=\mathbb{E}[Y(\mathbf{d})]$: average dose-response function
- $n$: total number of units
- $C_{ijk}$: $k^{th}$ confounder of the $j^{th}$ exposure for the $i^{th}$ individual

- Observed data
    - $(Y_{i}, D_{i1},\dots,D_{im}, C_{i11}, \dots, C_{i1p_{1}}, \dots, C_{im1}, \dots, C_{imp_{m}})$

# Identifying Assumptions
.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[Overview]

- Three key assumptions for valid causal quantities

1. Weak ignorability
1. Positivity
1. Stable-unit treatment value (SUTVA)

]
.panel[.panel-name[Weak ignorability]

- Exposure is conditionally independent of the potential outcomes given the
appropriate set of confounders.

\begin{align}
Y_{i}(\mathbf{d})\perp \!\!\! \perp\mathbf{D}_{i}\mid \mathcal{C} \quad \forall \quad \mathbf{d}\in\mathcal{D}.
\end{align}

- Replace $\mathcal{C}$ with $f_{\mathbf{D}\mid\mathcal{C}}$
    - Especially with high dimensional set and/or continuous confounders

- Difficult to rationalize
    - Requires perfect knowledge *and* collection of confounders
    - We assume it holds, i.e., no unmeasured confounding

- "Weak" refers to conditional independence for *each* level of exposure not *joint* distribution of exposures

]
.panel[.panel-name[Positivity]
.pull-left[
- All units have the potential to receive a particular level of exposure given
any value of the confounders

\begin{align}
0<f_{\mathbf{D}\mid\mathcal{C}}(\mathbf{D}=\mathbf{d}\mid \mathcal{C})<1  \quad \forall \quad \mathbf{d}\in\mathcal{D}
\end{align}

- Grid or **convex hull**

- **Trimmed** or untrimmed
]
.pull-right[

```{r chull_sim, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("sim_images/chull_sim.jpeg")
```
- $\text{Cov}(D_{1}, D_{2})=0.5$
- .indian-red[Convex hull] and .dodger-blue[grid]
]
]
.panel[.panel-name[SUTVA]
- The potential outcome of each unit does not depend on the exposure that other
units receive *and* that there exists only one version of each exposure

- Assumes there is no interference between units
    - No herd immunity

- No errors in defining the potential outcomes caused by **multiple versions** of
the exposure

- $Y_{i} = Y_{i}(\mathbf{d})$
]
]
---
# mvGPS

- Conditional probability of receiving multivariate exposure given set of confounders

\begin{align}
f(\mathbf{D}|\mathbf{C}_{1},\dots,\mathbf{C}_{m})
\end{align}

- For bias removal construct inverse probability of treatment weights

\begin{align}
w=\frac{f(\mathbf{D})}{f(\mathbf{D}|\mathbf{C}_{1},\dots,\mathbf{C}_{m})},
\end{align}

- Propose multivariate normal models
\begin{align}
\mathbf{D}\sim \text{N}_{m}(\boldsymbol{\mu}, \boldsymbol{\Sigma}) \quad \mathbf{D}\mid \mathbf{C}_{1},\dots,\mathbf{C}_{m}\sim \text{N}_{m}\Bigg(\begin{bmatrix}\boldsymbol{\beta}_{1}^{T}\mathbf{C}_{1}\\ \vdots \\ \boldsymbol{\beta}_{m}^{T}\mathbf{C}_{m}\end{bmatrix}, \boldsymbol{\Omega}\Bigg),
\end{align}
    - Tractable, well-behaved asymptotics, full univariate conditionals
    - Estimate parameters using ordinary least squares
---
# Properties of mvGPS weights

- Returns consistent estimate of average dose-response function
    - $\mathbb{E}[wY\mid\mathbf{D}]=\mathbb{E}[Y(\mathbf{d})]$

- Covariance between each exposure, $D_{j}$ and confounder, $C_{jk}$, is zero
    - $\mathbb{E}[w(D_{j}-\mu_{D_j})(C_{jk}-\mu_{C_{jk}})]=0$

- Weights are normalized and maintain marginal moments
    - $\mathbb{E}[w]=1$
    - $\mathbb{E}[w D_{j}]=\mathbb{E}[D_{j}]$
    - $\mathbb{E}[w\mathbf{C}_{j}]=\mathbb{E}[\mathbf{C}_{j}]$

# Simulation Study

# Design
- Sample size : $n=200$

- Repetitions: $B=1000$

- Compare mvGPS to other univariate alternative methods
    - Covariate balancing generalized propensity score, CBGPS, `r Citep(myBib,"fong2018")`
    - Entropy balancing `r Citep(myBib,"tbbicke2020entropy")`
    - Generalized linear propensity score, PS

- Simulate bivariate normal exposure
    - marginal correlation
    - overlap of confounding sets

- Effect of trimming weights `r Citep(myBib, "kang2007demystifying")`
    - None vs. 99th quantile vs 95th quantile

???
- Univariate methods may perform well when exposures are highly correlated and have the same confounders
    - Perform poorly with weakly correlated exposures and/or separate sets of confounders

# Takeaways

- Multivariate methods are critical for achieving proper balance across multiple exposures
    - Protects against any single confounder being strongly imbalanced
    - Slight penalty of lower average balance in certain scenarios
- Univariate methods achieved best balance with high overlap of confounders
    - Despite balance, high total bias of treatment effects
- Using multivariate weights decreased ESS resulting in lower power and higher RMSE
    - Weight trimming reduced these effects, $q=0.99$

# Takeaways

**Balance**

- Significant imbalance prior to weighting
    - mvGPS had greater reduction in imbalance than univariate methods

- ESS for all methods are reduced but power is still reasonably high

**Dose-Response**

- *Unweighted* estimate was monotonic plane where effectiveness increased as you increased either exposure dose

- *mvGPS* estimate was a saddle with optimal effectiveness using high micro and low macro
    - Showed that high levels of both exposures was less effective

# Discussion

<div class="cran-logo-right"></div>

- Achieved balance across multiple simultaneous exposures
- Adapted for confounding sets and/or correlation of exposures
- Visualized and interpreted effect of two continuous interventions with dose-response surface
- Defined high dimensional positivity space with convex hull
- [mvGPS](https://cran.r-project.org/package=mvGPS) R package available now on CRAN

### Limitations
- Multivariate normal parametric distribution
- Investigation of higher dimensional exposure
- Time-varying multivariate exposure
- Multiple versions possible for macro and micro doses
- Geographic interference (SUTVA violations)
